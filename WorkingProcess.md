# My Environments

* Dev will be on my laptop
* Staging environment will be on GitHub (I would have to set this up)
* Production environment will be on GoDaddy (Already a task has been defined for it)

# Proces/Work Flow
1. Pick a feature/bug. 
2. Decide whether to branch or work on the main branch
3. Plan to implement feature 
4. Check out
    - git pull origin master 
    - Work on files and folders
    - git add .
    - git commit -m 'For #IssueNumber' 
    - git push origin master 
5. If I have published on GitHub perform testing of the feature
