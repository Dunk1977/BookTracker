# About
This webapp would automate my book selection, reading and post reading process. 
It will build on this basic feature to allow more users to login and do the same. 
Then we will build features like ability to share your comments with others. 
We might also explore the option of having an online bookclub, where you can discuss a book. 

# Hosting
* I do not need to buy a new domain since I can use my existing domain as below
* In the future if I have more similar ideas, I can take more hosting spaces and host more apps in it.
* Eventually when I am comfortable, I will try to explore options for monetizing it.

# Basic Features
1. Ability to add a book that I fancy or is recommended to me. 
2. Ability to analyze the book and then decide whether I want to read or not. 
3. Once I decide reading to mark the book as reading and ability to capture notes for the book
4. Ability to post my review, summary of the book and notes for people to read and take help from. 
5. All of these features should be published and be usable on GitHub. 
6. Ask some people to check out and comment. 
7. Maybe I will publish it in my domain. 

# Users
* Users expected to come to my site: Me (I will be the main user of the website)
* Other users might come to read book reviews, find a book they want to read, read the notes of a book they have read and discuss it. 
* For users other than me, the 'Quick Action' bar should not be there.
